<p><strong>Last week my friend told me: “when I am with you, you
constantly see design in things I would never see. For instance the
bright yellow numbers construction workers spray paint on the pavement.
I wouldn’t even see it, but because you took a picture of it I am seeing
it everywhere now”.</strong>Looking back at my upbringing and my daily
life in Rotterdam, I realized how much the sight of its streets are a
source of inspiration in my work. Here I encounter serendipitous designs
everyday, that I keep in an archive on my phone. I am constantly busy
looking around me, hunting for these little quirks or details in my
surroundings. Things I find please my eye. Because I am a sucker for
design. And since you are reading this, I assume you are too. am writing
specifically to a first year graphic design student. in case you aren’t,
feel free to explore my thesis all the same. In any case: I welcome you.
Not that I am so much above you, I am also just getting started. And I
can tell you: the more you learn the more you learn you don’t know
anything. This thesis started as an attempt to understand something of
graphic design, but failed miserably. It left me with more questions…
but we’re in this together!</p>
<p>When I was in your shoes four years ago, I started to notice these
serendipitous designs. Looking back I think that was the combination of
my voyeurism and learning “How Design Is Actually Done<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>”.
In a surrounding with people who are all great designers - how lucky we
both are - I started to become intrigued with designs that don’t feel
“designed”; that have a certain rough, unpolished beauty. Designs which
were made by people who, most likely, are not designers. Designs that
are made vernacular.</p>
<p>In “We’re Here To Be Bad” Tibor Kalman writes <em>“Vernacular is a
slang, a language invented rather than taught. Vernacular design is a
visual slang. More than that it’s design that is so familiar that we
don’t really see it. Seeing the vernacular is seeing the invisible. It
is looking at something commonplace - a yellow pencil, a metal folding
chair- and falling in love<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>”. </em>Kalman aims us to
look at vernacular design not as an education, nor as a movement or
style in design, but rather as a practical approach to designing. It is
a direct supply of a design to the question of fixing one’s practical
need. Often it is done locally, when a store hires a sign painter to
paint their window-glass, or when the construction worker spray paints
numbers on the pavement to locate where they placed their underground
cables.</p>
<p>But we are training to become professional designers. And it is
exactly that paradox that makes vernacular design interesting to us. It
has not been given rules, there is no good and no bad. And that is what
is good about it. As individuals striving to become great designers, how
can we learn from vernacular? Are there ways in which we are able to
combine vernacular with strategy, as Hannah Montana would say; <em>the
best of both worlds<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>? </em>I am curious, what is the role
of vernacular design in graphic design and communication?</p>
<p>This summer I followed an internship at 75B in Rotterdam, where I had
the opportunity to work on this years IFFR campaign. A project in which
I saw the vernacular and the design worlds intermingle. IFFR has been
taking place in Rotterdam each year from 1972 until today, and over the
years has built up a reputation of placing political topics on the
agenda. In their 2021-2024 report they write <em>“IFFR manifests itself
as a ‘window to the world’, in which Rotterdam and the Netherlands open
up to the world, and vice versa. In doing so, the festival offers space
for intercultural dialogue and reflection in the city of Rotterdam. It
stimulates the expansion of mutual understanding between cultures or the
nuancing of existing prejudices - so important in today’s polarized
climate<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.”</em>As an event that is leading
for the city of Rotterdam and with an archive of over 50 years of
posters this seems a perfect documentation for us to explore different
visual era’s in graphic design.</p>
<p>I chose six designers which I think most interestingly reflect
graphic design’s development. Can we detect certain notions that caused
graphic designers to turn to the vernacular?</p>
<p>Let’s look at the very beginning of the IFFR: the posters designed by
Evert Maliangkay. Maliangkay was born in Rotterdam in 1941, where he
studied at the Willem de Kooning Academy; graphic design by day, and
autonomous art by night<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>One year before Maliangkay was born, Rotterdam had been bombed. In
1940, during the German Luftwaffe in the Blitz of the Second World War,
almost the entire city center was destroyed. This led to the time period
of <em>‘wederopbouw:’,</em> which is the process of rebuilding and
re-organizing a broken city. We will find out how this particular
context shaped the work of the emerging designers during those years.
When we look at the posters designed by Maliangkay in 1974, what is
immediately striking is the use of collage. The collage technique, or
more broadly, do-it-yourself (DIY) graphic design, emerged after the
Second World War when new technologies had been invented that made the
production of construction materials much cheaper. For instance the
invention of the photocopier in 1959<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. Because of easier
access to tools and materials, anyone with access could now become an
artist or designer. Artists, people, anyone, could now pick up scissors,
glue and copy a fancy design. This showed you didn’t need to be a
professional to make a great design.</p>
<p>The collage technique was made famous by the punk movement, who
picked up this wave of DIY design to make underground zines. The punk
movement was a reaction to the period after the war from the youth who
wanted freedom, and radically started to rebel against any kind of rules
or authority<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. Collage technique was one of the
visual languages that embodied this break. More precisely: it embodied a
breaking with the formal design rules that were set by modernist
designers.</p>
<p>From edition 6 until 10, the IFFR poster has been designed by the
Rotterdam artist and designer Gust Romijn. Gust Romijn was trained an
architect, but started to work as a sculptor, painter and graphic
artist<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p>When we compare his posters to the posters designed by Maliangkay,
Romijn’s designs look much more structured. That is mainly due to the
text placement, that is set in straight lines. This is a clear influence
of the use of a grid<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, introduced by the modernists.</p>
<p>The modernist movement was a completely different response to the
Second World War as we had seen from the punk movement. It was a
response in which designers wanted to create clarity and order in the
world through design. The design for an organization should have one
strategy, so its outings would maintain coherence. One could create
coherence by limiting the amount of choices in their design, in this
case by using a grid. The grid was a sheet of paper with lines, placed
under or on top of the design, on which text, image, and column
measurements were decided<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Another influence of the modernist movement visible in Romijn’s
design is the use of less or only monotone color, and the reduction of
photographic images to geometric shapes. These new design “rules” not
only created coherence but also made it easier for designers to give
specific instructions to printers. This gave way for production
processes to be mechanized and up-scaled, and that didn’t go unnoticed.
Soon large scaled organizations started to hire modernist graphic
designers to look at their identity. Service providers like airline KLM
or supermarket chain Albert Heijn employed design studios. A new genre
in visual culture emerged; corporate identities.</p>
<p>Corporate identities demanded a level of quality and skill that
graphic designers (like us) could only learn through a formal design
education. Where designers like Maliangkay rebelled against a corporate
graphic world by refusing to work with technically developed tools,
designers like Romijn kept up with the latest technical developments to
be able to work for, or with, corporate institutions.</p>
<p>The third folks in line to design the IFFR poster were the members of
Hard Werken. Hard Werken was a graphic design collective from Rotterdam,
formed in the late 1970’s and became fairly famous in the 1980’s. They
consisted out of Henk Elenga, Gerard Hadders, Tom van den Haspel, Rick
Vermeulen, Kees de Gruiter and Willem Kars<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the designs they made for IFFR from 1986 until 1992, Hard Werken
introduced staged photography to the poster. Gerard Hadders in an
interview<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> says the poster series are inspired
by the pre-digital special effects that were used in movies in the
1940’s. The tiger was built into a decor for each poster, which they
would photograph into a poster. Different techniques were used: neon,
hot metal, a flower bouquet or fake blood on pavement.</p>
<p>Hard Werken identified themselves with the postmodern generation of
designers. Postmodernism, as the term indicates, was formed after the
modernist movement. More than it could be described as a movement in
art, like modernism was, it could be described as a way of thinking
about design. Where modernist designers had strong beliefs in the level
quality you should achieve with your design, postmodern designers
believed anything could be art. They didn’t believe in boundaries
between that was seen as “high” and “low” art. Artists like Duchamp,
which I don’t doubt you know, presented “found” objects like a toilet
with a plate saying “fountain”, and that was then art. It rocked the art
world.</p>
<p>Hard Werken worked with found objects through staged photography. The
use of staged photography represents an important part of the
postmodernism philosophy. By presenting daily objects in a different
context, postmodern designers aimed to imagine a new world within the
already existing one. To re-imagine the daily, loose from the structures
that bind us to reality. This utopian idea started with the Situationist
movement in France, and can well be expressed with the quote
&lt;em”&gt;Sous les pavés, la plage!”.</em> Loosely translated to
<em>“beneath the pavement the beach”,</em> a slogan used in Paris
student revolts in May 1968. The slogan expressed the wish to
<em>“imagine another world, where other possibilities and alternative
ways of being and living existed —beyond the social and political
structures that immerse us, beyond the artificiality of living in a the
city<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>”.</em></p>
<p>At this time, Rotterdam was being rebuilt and growing into a one of
Holland’s capital cities. The harbor developed itself to become Europe’s
largest seaport, and gave way for large scaled organizations to house
there. Within these rapidly changing surroundings, using vernacular was
a way for postmodern designers to play with the given of reality. A
search for freedom and new visual expressions.</p>
<p>From 1996 until 2002, Max Kisman designed the festival poster. Kisman
was born in Doetinchem, and studied typography, illustration, animation
and graphic design at the AKI in Enschede and the Rietveld Academy in
Amsterdam<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Looking at Kisman’s posters I find it hard to distinguish a use of
vernacular. We could even say his poster series take a step away from
the vernacular. Kisman was the first to introduce digital effects to the
poster, before the computer became broadly accessible. The rise of the
personal-computer in the late 1990’s gave way to designers to work with
image and text in programs. In Kisman’s words <em>“The introduction of
the computer showed that everything is malleable. Manipulable<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>”.</em> The computer brought upon a
new generation of graphic designers that mastered design programs and
were able to design basically anything.</p>
<p>Much later when the home computer became affordable for modal
incomes, it became a tool for those who could afford a computer and who
had the time to learn new skills to be able to design. Now
<em>‘amateurs<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>’</em> could reach the same quality
work as designers. The level of quality that modernist graphic designers
held for the profession, was being challenged. And with that, the idea
of the graphic designer as a professional. When more people have access
to the same tools that were once exclusive for you as a graphic
designer, how could you still differentiate yourself within the
discipline?</p>
<p>After Max Kisman, Ontwerpwerk was the first in line to design the
IFFR poster. Ontwerpwerk started in 1986 as an advertisement and
strategy bureau in The Hague<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. Nowadays they are
with a team of 40 designers, digital experts and strategists, still
operative from The Hague.</p>
<p>What I find particularly striking is Ontwerpwerk’s posters for the
2002 IFFR campaign. For this edition they chose to showcase a selection
of stores and restaurants in Rotterdam with the festival’s information
and the IFFR logo by Max Kisman on top. In the first poster Ice Cream
parlor Venezia is photographed, and in the second the African restaurant
Mamma Essi. The idea behind this design was that everyone had to leave
because the Film Festival had begun, says Stephan Csikós<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>,
former designer at Ontwerpwerk.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see these poster compared to Kisman, in which
Ontwerpwerk uses vernacular quite literally. This seems like a turning
point, similar to the one we had seen before between the work of Romijn
and that of Hard Werken. Is this turn the search of the Festival for a
fresh voice? Or is this a pattern within the graphic design field? Could
the turn to vernacular possibly be a response of graphic designers after
periods of technical development? We have seen that technical
developments and broader accessibility to tools made graphic designers
to rethink their position, to wonder which role they want to take on
within the discipline. Of course this is not set in stone, but an
ongoing process that enfolds as you develop yourself as designer. I feel
Tibor Kalman’s writings could offer us an interesting perspective of a
graphic designer with a critical view towards the field: <em>“what is
than the point of practicing graphic design? To try and unlearn design.
To not design in ways corporations have taught us. And one way to do
this, is to look at vernacular design<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>”.
</em></p>
<p>With their photographs of Rotterdam’s of venues that show different
cultural outings, Ontwerpwerk tries to addresses the inhabitants of
Rotterdam through their collective identity. The collective identity
that has grown over time to call itself multicultural. Rotterdam’s
multicultural identity started to develop when the rebuilt of the city
after the Second World War called for extra hands. Many guest workers
came to the Netherlands to fill in the demand for work. Many guest
workers, who had built a living in the Netherlands stayed and became
citizens. Some saw the opportunity to earn an income by opening up small
businesses or venues.</p>
<p>These venues are one of the physical manifestations of the visual
vernacular of a group people. By photographing them Ontwerpwerk aims to
add another layer of cultural meaning to their posters. However, an
important side note to the use of vernacular with specific cultural
bound meanings- or uses is placed by Cuban designer Ernesto Oroza:
<em>“Romanticizing aesthetics that are born from poverty and scarcity
should be avoided. Vernacular should not be seen as an aesthetic
practice - even though in my opinion it often has beauty - it should be
seen as fixing one’s practical need with the tools one has<a
href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>”.</em> When working with
vernacular, I try to be aware of my own position as a white Dutch
graphic designer. Even though I have definitely forgot and will forget
it many times. I try to contextualize a vernacular, in order to avoid
painful missteps that could lead to appropriating or exotifying people
with a different ethnic background than me.</p>
<h4>
Done with the schools: 75B
</h4>
<p>In 2008 design agency 75B took over the identity of IFFR. 75B was
founded in 1997 by Robert Beckand, Rens Muis and Pieter Vos, who knew
each other from studying graphic design at the Willem de Kooning Academy
in Rotterdam. Nowadays the firm is run by Rens Muis and Pieter Vos,
still operating from Rotterdam<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In their second IFFR campaign they introduced the new logo and
identity, which is still in use this day.In 75B’s posters we see
different visual languages coming together. 75B is creating their own
visual languages out of different vernacular aesthetics. The use of
handwriting- and drawing is one of the ways in which they try to bring
an intimate, playful feel to their posters. What also stands out to me
is their 2013 poster series, in which the text they present on their
posters indicate a person talking, as if it is a script for a movie.
Through these techniques they try to give their campaign, quite
literally, a personal voice; a vernacular.</p>
<p>The time in which graphic designers nowadays are operating, is what
Florian Cramer calls the “post-digital<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>’
era. This is the era in which graphic design has become a hybrid of
“old” and “new” media. According to Rens Muis <em>“there are no schools
in design anymore. You take whatever technique suits your idea, and use
it<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>”.</em> Through expansion of digital
techniques such as social-media, we have access and knowledge about many
different visual languages. 75B is using techniques that are supported
by technology; the type and logo, combined with ones that can not (yet)
be reached through technology; the writing of one’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>One of the main purposes the IFFR campaign fulfills, is to
motivate people to attend the festival. We have seen throughout our
case-study, that the use of vernacular in this regard has often been one
of aesthetics. What happens when vernacular is used for a different
purpose? Which roles do graphic designers take on then? Let’s try to
find out through this personal selection of contemporary graphic design
projects.</strong></p>
<p>As much as graphic designers can use vernacular to address a specific
group, the same can be done but then to criticize a specific group. More
specifically: graphic designers can use their position and knowledge of
design to detect marketing strategies of (large scaled) organizations,
and possibly make other people aware of them. By combining two marketing
strategies with opposed goals, 75B turn both communications against
itself, creating an ironic message<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Another graphic designer that takes on the role of critic in
designing with vernacular, is Yuri Veerman. Here he uses the visual
language of mass manufacturers and political parties to transmit his own
messages. By using vernacular that has become mainstream, graphic
designers can its familiarity as a tool to attract the attention of
their viewer.</p>
<p>Rather than using vernacular for designing, Hardworking Goodlooking
makes a practice out of researching a specific vernacular. They do this
by carefully documenting it, and then by working together with local
designers, to make small scale publications. Through publicizing, they
aim to transmit this knowledge. By making evident a vernacular, as
Hardworking Goodlooking does, we graphic designers can play a part in
celebrating a culture. Hardworking Goodlooking takes on the role of
researcher and collaborator in using vernacular<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The next designer is working with the physical manifestations of
vernacular design. Helmut Smits uses vernacular objects as contemporary
<em>found objects</em>. By reshaping their known forms into new objects,
he aims to rethink the meaning of those objects in our daily life. Smits
takes on a more fine arts approach to working with vernacular.</p>
<p>In his project “Scheve Palen” or “Slammed Posts” Onno Blase looks at
the street with a poetic eye. He notices a visual language that is
coincidental. Blase says “It’s super simple idea and a maniacal project.
I hope it brings a smile to your face. I hope it makes you look around
more when you’re walking or cycling through your city, and observe what
you see<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>.” Designers like Onno Blase and
Helmut Smits transform the daily activity of vision itself into a more
self-conscious activity. To not only see the world, but see the beauty,
humor or what so ever in everyday things. It is interesting to see in
Blase’s project that vernacular has been taking on a digital dimension.
By sharing these findings on Instagram Slammed Posts turned into a
collaborative project between Blase and his followers, creating a sense
of community. A poetic and communal approach to working with
vernacular.</p>
<p><strong>While writing this thesis I realized researching vernacular
can’t only be done by analyzing the work of designers… I decided to
investigate the vernacular of my own surroundings, starting in my
neighborhood.</strong></p>
<p>I have been living on the Admiraal de Ruyterweg for almost five years
now. I have seen the local bridal store go, and a big, polished
<em>Appie <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></em>take its place. I have seen the
elderly moving out of apartments next to mine, and young, urban,
professionals, moving in. The process of gentrification<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
has played out before my eyes, and when I imagine my neighborhood in 20
years I only see this developing further. This doesn’t sound so nice
does it, <em>hé<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></em>?</p>
<p>That is why I started to look at the local places that are still
there. The places that bring a sense of identity to my neighborhood.</p>
<p>What I found interesting to see in many of the designs of
storefronts, is the use of certain symbols, that you could say are
universal in their use. I kept spotting these symbols, and it appealed
to me that fairly some stores creatively combined different ones.
Creating very specific, personal meanings. I started to sketch with the
designs of these window sights, trying to see if I could gain more
knowledge over these visual languages by using them myself. During this
process I often thought back to Oroza: <em>“Romanticizing aesthetics
that are born from poverty and scarcity should be avoided. […] it should
be seen as fixing one’s practical need with the tools one has”. </em>I
often felt a bit obliged to make these sketches. Because, with my
expensive laptop and my access to basically any design tool through my
design education, what am I trying to do? At first hand the sketching
felt a bit aimless, to be honest. However, when I went back to my
Instagram archive, I started to understand. It is the capturing of small
details, quirky edges and smirky stains that I have been trying to do,
as an attempt to preserve the things that bring life to my surroundings.
They are a hunting towards the authentic parts of a place. The parts
that give a place its identity.</p>
<p>I saw that I especially do it in the places I feel are getting too
‘clean’, like my neighborhood that is getting gentrified, or in case of
my Instagram, social media platforms that are getting cleaned by
algorithms. These subtle changes will, unconsciously, change your view
of the world. What do we lose when an <em>appie</em> replaces the local
supermarket? And in 20 years, will I still be able to see spray painted
numbers on the pavement, and feel the tingle to design a poster?</p>
<p>Our surroundings are changing so rapidly, but to notice these things
is important. It is the first step in lending a voice to your
surrounding, something we, graphic designers, are training to do for a
living. These pictures are the evidence of my surrounding talking to me,
let them talk to you.</p>
