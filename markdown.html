<p>Chapter 3: Kalman, Tibor and Karrie Jacobs - We’re here to be Bad
p. 124</p>
<p><strong>For this chapter I divided the posters in six timeframes,
divided by six makers (see fig. 1). I chose six designers of which I
think most interestingly reflect graphic design’s development. Can we
detect certain notions that caused graphic designers to turn to the
vernacular? My ambition is not to provide you with a complete history of
graphic design, but rather, to help both you and me to start a little
more informed designers that we are.</strong></p>
<p>Punk Panthers: Evert Maliangkay</p>
<p>Let’s look at the very beginning of the IFFR: the posters designed by
Evert Maliangkay. Maliangkay was born in Rotterdam in 1941, where he
studied at the Willem de Kooning Academy; Graphic Design by day, and
Autonomous Art by night.</p>
<p>One year before Maliangkay was born, Rotterdam had been bombed. In
1940, during the German Luftwaffe in the blitz of the Second World War,
almost the entire city center had been destroyed. During our first few
designers (from Evert Maliangkay until Hard Werken) the city was still
in wederopbouw, the process of rebuilding and re-organizing a broken
city. When we look at the posters designed by Maliangkay in 1974, what
is immediately striking, is the use of collage. The collage technique,
or more broadly, do-it-yourself (DIY) graphic design, emerged after the
Second World War when new technologies had been invented that made the
production of construction materials much cheaper. For instance the
invention of the photocopier in 1959. Because of the access to tools and
materials, anyone now could be an artist or designers. Artists, people,
anyone, could now pick up scissors, glue and copy a fancy design. This
showed you didn’t need to be a professional to make a great design. The
collage technique was made famous by the punk movement, who picked up
this wave of DIY design to make underground zines. The punk movement was
a reaction on the period after the war from the youth, who wanted
freedom and radically started to rebel any kind of rules or authority.
Collage technique was perfect to break away from formal design rules set
by modernist. Visual language does not only serve stylistic purpose, but
is acts as an identifier of which social group you (want to) belong
to.</p>
<p>Griddy Gust: Gust Romijn</p>
<p>From edition 6 until 10, the IFFR poster has been designed by the
Rotterdam artist and designer Gust Romijn. Gust Romijn was trained an
architect, but started to work as a sculptor, painter and graphic
artist.</p>
<p>When we compare these posters to the posters designed by Maliangkay,
these ones look much more structured. That is mainly due to the text
placement, that is done straight, in lines. This was a clear influence
of the use of a grid, introduced by the modernists. The modernist
movement was a completely different response to the Second World War as
we had seen from the punk movement. It was a response in which designers
wanted to create clarity and order in the world through design. Design
for one organization should have one coherent strategy. One could create
coherence by limiting the amount of choices in their design; by using a
grid.</p>
<p>The grid was a sheet of paper with lines, placed under or on top of
the design, on which text, image, and column measurements where decided.
Aside from using a grid, the influence of modernists was the use of less
or only monotone color, and illustrations reduced to geometric
shapes.<br />
These new design “rules” not only created coherence but also made it
easier for designers to give specific instructions to printers. This
gave way for production processes to be mechanized and up-scaled. The
visual coherence and the mechanization soon caused big companies to hire
modernist graphic designers to look at their identity. Service providers
like airline KLM or supermarket chain Albert Heijn employed design
studios. A new genre in visual culture emerged; corporate
identities.</p>
<p>Corporate identities demanded a level of quality and skill that
graphic designers (like us) could only learn through a formal design
education. Where at the one side of the coin of these technical
developments, designers like Maliangkay joined the movement of designers
being ‘amateurs’ by refusing to work with them, others like Romijn used
them to keep up with the corporate business.</p>
<p>Rotterdamse cowboys: Hard Werken</p>
<p>The third ones in line to design the IFFR posters were the members of
Hard Werken. Hard Werken was a graphic design collective in Rotterdam,
formed in the late 1970’s and became quite famous in the 1980’s. They
consisted out of Henk Elenga, Gerard Hadders, Tom van den Haspel, Rick
Vermeulen, Kees de Gruiter and Willem Kars. In the designs they made for
IFFR from 1986 until 1992, Hard Werken introduced staged photography to
the poster. Gerard Hadders in an interview says the poster series are
inspired by the pre-digital special effects that were used in movies in
the 1940’s. The tiger was built into a decor for each poster, which they
would photograph into a poster. Different techniques were used: neon,
hot metal, a flower bouquet or fake blood on pavement.</p>
<p>Hard Werken identified themself with the postmodern generation of
designers. Postmodernism, as the term indicates, was formed opposed the
modernist movement. It was more a way of thinking about design than it
could be described as an art movement. Where modernist designers claimed
their stance as being an authority in deciding what is “good” design,
postmodern designers wanted to erase the boundaries between ‘high’ and
‘low’ art because they found anything could be art. Artists like
Duchamp, which I don’t doubt you know, presented “found” objects like a
toilet with a plate saying “fountain”, and that was then art. It rocked
the art world.</p>
<p>Hard Werken worked with found objects through staged photography. In
their book “Hard Werken - One For All” they show that by presenting
everyday objects in a different context, staged photography was a way
through which they could imagine a new world within the already existing
one.</p>
<p>This utopian idea can well be expressed in the quote “Sous les pavés,
la plage!”, which loosely translates to “underneath the pavement the
beach”, a slogan used in Paris student revolts in May 1968. The slogan
expressed the wish to imagine another world, where other possibilities
and alternative ways of being and living existed, beyond all the social
and political structures that we are in, beyond the artificiality of
living in a big city.</p>
<p>At this time Rotterdam was being rebuilt and growing into a big city.
The harbor expanded into the largest seaport of Europe, housing big
companies. Modernist designers grew into marketing designers, using
visual strategies. Postmodern designers like Hard Werken then used
vernacular as a way to look critical at the growing consumer culture in
Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Kisman and the PC: Max Kisman</p>
<p>From 1996 until 2002 Max Kisman designed the festival poster. Kisman
was born in Doetinchem, and between 1972 and 1977 he studied typography,
illustration, animation and graphic design, at the AKI in Enschede and
the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>When we look at the posters, we see that Kisman was the first to
introduce digital effects. The rise of the personal-computer in the late
1990’s gave way to designers to work with image and text in programs. In
Kisman’s words “The introduction of the computer showed that everything
is malleable. Manipulable”. The computer brought upon a new generation
of graphic designers that mastered design programs, and where able to
design basically anything. Graphic designers started to play with
typefaces and effects on images.</p>
<p>Not only did the home computer give way to designers to broaden their
visual language, but when the home computer became affordable it became
a tool for everyone and anyone to be able to design. Now ‘amateurs’
could reach the same level of quality as designers. The level of quality
that modernist graphic designers held for the profession, was being
challenged. And with that, the idea of the graphic designer as a
professional. Because if everyone was now a good designer, how could you
differentiate yourself?</p>
<p>To Romanticize or not to romanticize (Ontwerpwerk)</p>
<p>After Max Kisman, Ontwerpwerk designed the IFFR poster. Ontwerpwerk
started in 1986 as an advertisement and strategy bureau, in The Hague.
Nowadays they are with a team of 40 designers, digital experts and
strategists, and are still operative from The Hague. On the 19th of
January I was able to talk to former Ontwerpwerk member Stephan Csikós
through e-mail.What is particularly striking in their series of posters
is their 2002 poster, in which they showcase a series of stores and
restaurants in Rotterdam, with the festival’s information and the IFFR
logo by Max Kisman on top. In the first poster Ice Cream parlor Venezia
is photographed, and in the second the African restaurant Mamma Essi.
Stephan Csikós told me that the idea behind this design was that
everyone had to leave because the Film Festival had begun.</p>
<p>What is interesting when comparing these posters to the ones made by
Kisman, is that through the facades Ontwerpwerk is quite literally using
vernacular in their design. We can start to detect a pattern here: when
technical developments in the graphic field take place, graphic
designers are made to rethink their position. In commercial settings,
often by having to distinguish themselves in a way. In “We’re Here to be
Bad” Tibor Kalman writes: “what is then the point of practicing graphic
design? To try and unlearn design. To not design in ways corporations
have taught us. And one way to do this, is to look at vernacular
design”.</p>
<p>With their photographs of Roffa’s streetvernacular, Ontwerpwerk
addresses the inhabitants of Rotterdam. They address them with something
Rotterdam has come to be known for; their multicultural identity. This
identity started to develop when the rebuilt of the city after WW2
demanded extra hands. In the years after the war many guest workers came
to the Netherlands. Most of those guest workers stayed and became
working-class citizens, opening up their own small business.</p>
<p>These businesses are one of the physical manifestations of the visual
vernacular of a people. People with another cultural background then us
can form an interesting subject to use the vernacular of. And for many
graphic designers, it does. However, an important side note to this is
placed by Cuban designer Ernesto Oroza: ““Romanticizing aesthetics that
are born from poverty and scarcity should be avoided. Vernacular should
not be seen as an aesthetic practice - even though in my opinion it
often has beauty - it should be seen as fixing one’s practical need with
the tools one has”.</p>
<p>The shepards: 75B</p>
<p>In 2008 the Rotterdam design agency 75B took over the identity of
IFFR. 75B was founded in 1997 by Robert Beckand, Rens Muis and Pieter
Vos, who knew each other from studying graphic design at the Willem de
Kooning Academy in Rotterdam. Nowadays the firm is ran by Rens Muis and
Pieter Vos, and is still housed in Rotterdam. In their second IFFR
campaign they introduced the new logo and identity, which is still in
use of today.</p>
<p>In 75B’s posters we see different visual languages coming together.
The time in which graphic designers nowadays are operating, is what
Florian Cramer calls the “post-digital’ era. This is the era in which
graphic design has become a hybrid of “old” and “new” media. Rens Muis
he told me “there are no schools in design anymore. You take whatever
technique suits your idea, and use it”. Through expansion of digital
techniques such as social-media, we have access and knowledge about many
different visual languages.</p>
<p>In comparison to Ontwerpwerk, 75B is creating their own visual
languages out of different vernacular aesthetics. When combining or
morphing such specific visual languages, graphic designers can play with
certain cultural or social codes. 75B is not only using vernacular, they
also research their target audience through detecting their vernacular
behaviors. Using vernacular is thus a way in which graphic designers can
socially organize a group.</p>
