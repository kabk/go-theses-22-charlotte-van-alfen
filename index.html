                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Looking back at my upbringing and daily life in Rotterdam, I realized
                    how much the sight of its streets are a source of inspiration in my
                    work. While studying graphic design, I became intrigued with designs
                    that are designed without a design-strategy; vernacular design.
                    Vernacular is defined as an informal visual- and spoken language that
                    belongs to a specific group of people. It is invented rather than
                    taught. I am curious, what is the role of vernacular design within
                    graphic design and communication?</p>
                <details class="is-read-more">
                    <summary>read more...</summary>
                    <p>In the form of letter to a fellow student I aim to invite the reader
                        to engage with the material. I start by analyzing developments in art
                        and design that led graphic designers to use vernacular in their work.
                        For this I use the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) poster
                        as a case-study. IFFR has been taking place in Rotterdam each year from
                        1972 until today. As an event that is leading for the city of Rotterdam
                        and with an archive of over 50 years of posters this seems a perfect
                        documentation of different visual era’s in graphic design. I see that
                        IFFR's campaign aims to motivate people to come to the festival. In
                        this context, vernacular functions as a tool for graphic designers to
                        reach a specific target audience. I notice a pattern of graphic
                        designers reaching towards the vernacular in periods of technical
                        development. Development of and broader accessibility of tools make them
                        to rethink their position as graphic designers.</p>
                        <p>Through a personal selection of contemporary graphic design projects,
                        I investigate which roles graphic designers take on when they use
                        vernacular for purposes beyond the aesthetic. I see that appropriating
                        mainstream vernacular is a way graphic designers can position themselves
                        as critics in the field. By making evident a vernacular, through
                        documentation and publicizing, graphic designers can take part in
                        celebrating a culture. On a more artistic level, graphic designers can
                        create new and poetic vernaculars by spotting visual languages that
                        happen coincidentally.</p>
                        <p>In the last chapter I start researching the vernacular of my own
                        surroundings. By sketching with the visual languages used in the
                        storefronts of my street, I realize using vernacular is a way for me to
                        preserve the parts of my surrounding that I feel carry its
                        authenticity.</p>

            <summary>Introduction</summary>
            <p><strong>Last week my friend told me: “when I am with you, you
                constantly see design in things I would never see. For instance the
                bright yellow numbers construction workers spray paint on the pavement.
                I wouldn’t even see it, but because you took a picture of it I am seeing
                it everywhere now”.</strong></p>
                <p>Looking back at my upbringing and my daily life in Rotterdam, I
                realized how much the sight of its streets are a source of inspiration
                in my work. Here I encounter serendipitous designs everyday, that I keep
                in an archive on my phone. I am constantly busy looking around me,
                hunting for these little quirks or details in my surroundings. Things I
                find please my eye. Because I am a sucker for design. And since you are
                reading this, I assume you are too. am writing specifically to a first
                year graphic design student. in case you aren’t, feel free to explore my
                thesis all the same. In any case: I welcome you. Not that I am so much
                above you, I am also just getting started. And I can tell you: the more
                you learn the more you learn you don’t know anything. This thesis
                started as an attempt to understand something of graphic design, but
                failed miserably. It left me with more questions… but we’re in this
                together!</p>
                <p>When I was in your shoes four years ago, I started to notice these
                serendipitous designs. Looking back I think that was the combination of
                my voyeurism and learning “How Design Is Actually Done<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>”.
                In a surrounding with people who are all great designers - how lucky we
                both are - I started to become intrigued with designs that don’t feel
                “designed”; that have a certain rough, unpolished beauty. Designs which
                were made by people who, most likely, are not designers. Designs that
                are made vernacular.</p>
                <p>In “We’re Here To Be Bad” Tibor Kalman writes <em>“Vernacular is a
                slang, a language invented rather than taught. Vernacular design is a
                visual slang. More than that it’s design that is so familiar that we
                don’t really see it. Seeing the vernacular is seeing the invisible. It
                is looking at something commonplace - a yellow pencil, a metal folding
                chair- and falling in love<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>”. </em>Kalman aims us to
                look at vernacular design not as an education, nor as a movement or
                style in design, but rather as a practical approach to designing. It is
                a direct supply of a design to the question of fixing one’s practical
                need. Often it is done locally, when a store hires a sign painter to
                paint their window-glass, or when the construction worker spray paints
                numbers on the pavement to locate where they placed their underground
                cables.</p>
                <p>But we are training to become professional designers. And it is
                exactly that paradox that makes vernacular design interesting to us. It
                has not been given rules, there is no good and no bad. And that is what
                is good about it. As individuals striving to become great designers, how
                can we learn from vernacular? Are there ways in which we are able to
                combine vernacular with strategy, as Hannah Montana would say; <em>the
                best of both worlds<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>? </em>I am curious, what is the role
                of vernacular design in graphic design and communication?</p>
                <p>This summer I followed an internship at 75B in Rotterdam, where I had
                the opportunity to work on this years IFFR campaign. A project in which
                I saw the vernacular and the design worlds intermingle. IFFR has been
                taking place in Rotterdam each year from 1972 until today, and over the
                years has built up a reputation of placing political topics on the
                agenda. In their 2021-2024 report they write <em>“IFFR manifests itself
                as a ‘window to the world’, in which Rotterdam and the Netherlands open
                up to the world, and vice versa. In doing so, the festival offers space
                for intercultural dialogue and reflection in the city of Rotterdam. It
                stimulates the expansion of mutual understanding between cultures or the
                nuancing of existing prejudices - so important in today’s polarized
                climate<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.”</em>As an event that is leading
                for the city of Rotterdam and with an archive of over 50 years of
                posters this seems a perfect documentation for us to explore different
                visual era’s in graphic design.</p>

            <h3>Vernacular of the past: a case study of 6 periods of IFFR posters</h3>
            <p><strong>I chose six designers which I think most interestingly reflect
                graphic design’s development. Can we detect certain notions that caused
                graphic designers to turn to the vernacular?</strong></p>
                <h4>
                Punk Panthers: Evert Maliangkay
                </h4>
                <p>Let’s look at the very beginning of IFFR: the posters designed by
                    Evert Maliangkay. Maliangkay was born in Rotterdam in 1941, where he
                    studied at the Willem de Kooning Academy; graphic design by day, and
                    autonomous art by night<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>One year before Maliangkay was born, Rotterdam had been bombed. In
                        1940, during the German Luftwaffe in the Blitz of the Second World War,
                        almost the entire city center was destroyed. This led to the time period
                        of <em>‘wederopbouw:’,</em> which is the process of rebuilding and
                        re-organizing a broken city. We will find out how this particular
                        context shaped the work of the emerging designers during those years.
                        When we look at the posters designed by Maliangkay in 1974, what is
                        immediately striking is the use of collage. The collage technique, or
                        more broadly, do-it-yourself (DIY) graphic design, emerged after the
                        Second World War when new technologies had been invented that made the
                        production of construction materials much cheaper. For instance the
                        invention of the photocopier in 1959<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. Because of easier
                        access to tools and materials, anyone with access could now become an
                        artist or designer. Artists, people, anyone, could now pick up scissors,
                        glue and copy a fancy design. This showed you didn’t need to be a
                        professional to make a great design.</p>
                        <p>The collage technique was made famous by the punk movement, who
                            picked up this wave of DIY design to make underground zines. The punk
                            movement was a reaction to the period after the war from the youth who
                            wanted freedom, and radically started to rebel against any kind of rules
                            or authority<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. Collage technique was one of the
                            visual languages that embodied this break. More precisely: it embodied a
                            breaking with the formal design rules that were set by modernist
                            designers.</p>

            <h4>Griddy Gust: Gust Romijn</h4>
            <p>From edition 6 until 10, IFFR's poster has been designed by the
                Rotterdam artist and designer Gust Romijn. Gust Romijn was trained an
                architect, but started to work as a sculptor, painter and graphic
                artist<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>When we compare his posters to the posters designed by Maliangkay,
                Romijn’s designs look much more structured. That is mainly due to the
                text placement, that is set in straight lines. This is a clear influence
                of the use of a grid<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, introduced by the modernists.</p>
                <p>The modernist movement was a completely different response to the
                Second World War as we had seen from the punk movement. It was a
                response in which designers wanted to create clarity and order in the
                world through design. The design for an organization should have one
                strategy, so its outings would maintain coherence. One could create
                coherence by limiting the amount of choices in their design, in this
                case by using a grid. The grid was a sheet of paper with lines, placed
                under or on top of the design, on which text, image, and column
                measurements were decided<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
                <p>Another influence of the modernist movement visible in Romijn’s
                design is the use of less or only monotone color, and the reduction of
                photographic images to geometric shapes. These new design “rules” not
                only created coherence but also made it easier for designers to give
                specific instructions to printers. This gave way for production
                processes to be mechanized and up-scaled, and that didn’t go unnoticed.
                Soon large scaled organizations started to hire modernist graphic
                designers to look at their identity. Service providers like airline KLM
                or supermarket chain Albert Heijn employed design studios. A new genre
                in visual culture emerged; corporate identities.</p>
                <p>Corporate identities demanded a level of quality and skill that
                graphic designers (like us) could only learn through a formal design
                education. Where designers like Maliangkay rebelled against a corporate
                graphic world by refusing to work with technically developed tools,
                designers like Romijn kept up with the latest technical developments to
                be able to work for, or with, corporate institutions.</p>

            <h4>Rotterdamse Cowboys: Hard Werken</h4>
            <p>The third folks in line to design IFFR's poster were the members of
                Hard Werken. Hard Werken was a graphic design collective from Rotterdam,
                formed in the late 1970’s and became fairly famous in the 1980’s. They
                consisted out of Henk Elenga, Gerard Hadders, Tom van den Haspel, Rick
                Vermeulen, Kees de Gruiter and Willem Kars<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>In the designs they made for IFFR from 1986 until 1992, Hard Werken
                introduced staged photography to the poster. Gerard Hadders in an
                interview<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> says the poster series are inspired
                by the pre-digital special effects that were used in movies in the
                1940’s. The tiger was built into a decor for each poster, which they
                would photograph into a poster. Different techniques were used: neon,
                hot metal, a flower bouquet or fake blood on pavement.</p>
                <p>Hard Werken identified themselves with the postmodern generation of
                designers. Postmodernism, as the term indicates, was formed after the
                modernist movement. More than it could be described as a movement in
                art, like modernism was, it could be described as a way of thinking
                about design. Where modernist designers had strong beliefs in the level
                quality you should achieve with your design, postmodern designers
                believed anything could be art. They didn’t believe in boundaries
                between that was seen as “high” and “low” art. Artists like Duchamp,
                which I don’t doubt you know, presented “found” objects like a toilet
                with a plate saying “fountain”, and that was then art. It rocked the art
                world.</p>
                <p>Hard Werken worked with found objects through staged photography. The
                use of staged photography represents an important part of the
                postmodernism philosophy. By presenting daily objects in a different
                context, postmodern designers aimed to imagine a new world within the
                already existing one. To re-imagine the daily, loose from the structures
                that bind us to reality. This utopian idea started with the Situationist
                movement in France, and can well be expressed with the quote
                &lt;em”&gt;Sous les pavés, la plage!”. Loosely translated to
                <em>“beneath the pavement the beach”,</em> a slogan used in Paris
                student revolts in May 1968. The slogan expressed the wish to
                <em>“imagine another world, where other possibilities and alternative
                ways of being and living existed —beyond the social and political
                structures that immerse us, beyond the artificiality of living in a the
                city<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>”.</em></p>
                <p>At this time, Rotterdam was being rebuilt and growing into a one of
                Holland’s capital cities. The harbor developed itself to become Europe’s
                largest seaport, and gave way for large scaled organizations to house
                there. Within these rapidly changing surroundings, using vernacular was
                a way for postmodern designers to play with the given of reality. A
                search for freedom and new visual expressions.</p>
            <h4>Kisman and the Computer: Max Kisman</h4>
            <p>From 1996 until 2002, Max Kisman designed the festival poster. Kisman
                was born in Doetinchem, and studied typography, illustration, animation
                and graphic design at the AKI in Enschede and the Rietveld Academy in
                Amsterdam<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Looking at Kisman’s posters I find it hard to distinguish a use of
                vernacular. We could even say his poster series take a step away from
                the vernacular. Kisman was the first to introduce digital effects to the
                poster, before the computer became broadly accessible. The rise of the
                personal-computer in the late 1990’s gave way to designers to work with
                image and text in programs. In Kisman’s words <em>“The introduction of
                the computer showed that everything is malleable. Manipulable<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>”.</em> The computer brought upon a
                new generation of graphic designers that mastered design programs and
                were able to design basically anything.</p>
                <p>Much later when the home computer became affordable for modal
                incomes, it became a tool for those who could afford a computer and who
                had the time to learn new skills to be able to design. Now
                <em>‘amateurs<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>’</em> could reach the same quality
                work as designers. The level of quality that modernist graphic designers
                held for the profession, was being challenged. And with that, the idea
                of the graphic designer as a professional. When more people have access
                to the same tools that were once exclusive for you as a graphic
                designer, how could you still differentiate yourself within the
                discipline?</p>
            <h4>To Romanticize or not to romanticize: Ontwerpwerk</h4>
            <p>After Max Kisman, Ontwerpwerk was the first in line to design the
                IFFR poster. Ontwerpwerk started in 1986 as an advertisement and
                strategy bureau in The Hague<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. Nowadays they are
                with a team of 40 designers, digital experts and strategists, still
                operative from The Hague.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>What I find particularly striking is Ontwerpwerk’s posters for the
                2002 IFFR campaign. For this edition they chose to showcase a selection
                of stores and restaurants in Rotterdam with the festival’s information
                and IFFR's logo by Max Kisman on top. In the first poster Ice Cream
                parlor Venezia is photographed, and in the second the African restaurant
                Mamma Essi. The idea behind this design was that everyone had to leave
                because the Film Festival had begun, says Stephan Csikós<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>,
                former designer at Ontwerpwerk.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to see these poster compared to Kisman, in which
                Ontwerpwerk uses vernacular quite literally. This seems like a turning
                point, similar to the one we had seen before between the work of Romijn
                and that of Hard Werken. Is this turn the search of the Festival for a
                fresh voice? Or is this a pattern within the graphic design field? Could
                the turn to vernacular possibly be a response of graphic designers after
                periods of technical development? We have seen that technical
                developments and broader accessibility to tools made graphic designers
                to rethink their position, to wonder which role they want to take on
                within the discipline. Of course this is not set in stone, but an
                ongoing process that enfolds as you develop yourself as designer. I feel
                Tibor Kalman’s writings could offer us an interesting perspective of a
                graphic designer with a critical view towards the field: <em>“what is
                than the point of practicing graphic design? To try and unlearn design.
                To not design in ways corporations have taught us. And one way to do
                this, is to look at vernacular design<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>”.
                </em></p>
                <p>With their photographs of Rotterdam’s of venues that show different
                cultural outings, Ontwerpwerk tries to addresses the inhabitants of
                Rotterdam through their collective identity. The collective identity
                that has grown over time to call itself multicultural. Rotterdam’s
                multicultural identity started to develop when the rebuilt of the city
                after the Second World War called for extra hands. Many guest workers
                came to the Netherlands to fill in the demand for work. Many guest
                workers, who had built a living in the Netherlands stayed and became
                citizens. Some saw the opportunity to earn an income by opening up small
                businesses or venues.</p>
                <p>These venues are one of the physical manifestations of the visual
                vernacular of a group people. By photographing them Ontwerpwerk aims to
                add another layer of cultural meaning to their posters. However, an
                important side note to the use of vernacular with specific cultural
                bound meanings- or uses is placed by Cuban designer Ernesto Oroza:
                <em>“Romanticizing aesthetics that are born from poverty and scarcity
                should be avoided. Vernacular should not be seen as an aesthetic
                practice - even though in my opinion it often has beauty - it should be
                seen as fixing one’s practical need with the tools one has<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>”.</em> When working with
                vernacular, I try to be aware of my own position as a white Dutch
                graphic designer. Even though I have definitely forgot and will forget
                it many times. I try to contextualize a vernacular, in order to avoid
                painful missteps that could lead to appropriating or exotifying people
                with a different ethnic background than me.</p>
            <h4>Done with the schools: 75B</h4>
            <p>In 2008 design agency 75B took over the identity of IFFR. 75B was
                founded in 1997 by Robert Beckand, Rens Muis and Pieter Vos, who knew
                each other from studying graphic design at the Willem de Kooning Academy
                in Rotterdam. Nowadays the firm is run by Rens Muis and Pieter Vos,
                still operating from Rotterdam<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>

        <p>In their second IFFR campaign they introduced the new logo and
            identity, which is still in use this day.In 75B’s posters we see
            different visual languages coming together. 75B is creating their own
            visual languages out of different vernacular aesthetics. The use of
            handwriting- and drawing is one of the ways in which they try to bring
            an intimate, playful feel to their posters. What also stands out to me
            is their 2013 poster series, in which the text they present on their
            posters indicate a person talking, as if it is a script for a movie.
            Through these techniques they try to give their campaign, quite
            literally, a personal voice; a vernacular.</p>
            <p>The time in which graphic designers nowadays are operating, is what
            Florian Cramer calls the “post-digital<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>’
            era. This is the era in which graphic design has become a hybrid of
            “old” and “new” media. According to Rens Muis <em>“there are no schools
            in design anymore. You take whatever technique suits your idea, and use
            it<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>”.</em> Through expansion of digital
            techniques such as social-media, we have access and knowledge about many
            different visual languages. 75B is using techniques that are supported
            by technology; the type and logo, combined with ones that can not (yet)
            be reached through technology; the writing of one’s hand.</p>

            <h3>Vernacular of the present: 5 contemporary graphic designers working with vernacular</h3>
            <p><strong>One of the main purposes IFFR's campaign fulfills, is to
                motivate people to attend the festival. We have seen throughout our
                case-study, that the use of vernacular in this regard has often been one
                of aesthetics. What happens when vernacular is used for a different
                purpose? Which roles do graphic designers take on then? Let’s try to
                find out through this personal selection of contemporary graphic design
                projects.</strong></p>
            <figure>
                <img loading="lazy" src="content/images/h2/75B_breda1.jpg" alt="figure1" width="100%" height="auto">
                <figcaption>Contribution to the mupi project by  <a class="external-link" href="https://www.75b.nl/">75B</a>
                </figcaption>
                
                <img loading="lazy" src="content/images/h2/75B_breda2.jpg" alt="figure1" width="100%" height="auto">
                <figcaption>Contribution to the mupi project by  <a class="external-link" href="https://www.75b.nl/">75B</a>
                </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>As much as graphic designers can use vernacular to address a specific
                    group, the same can be done but then to criticize a specific group. More
                    specifically: graphic designers can use their position and knowledge of
                    design to detect marketing strategies of (large scaled) organizations,
                    and possibly make other people aware of them. By combining two marketing
                    strategies with opposed goals, 75B turn both communications against
                    itself, creating an ironic message<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>Another graphic designer that takes on the role of critic in
                designing with vernacular, is Yuri Veerman. Here he uses the visual
                language of mass manufacturers and political parties to transmit his own
                messages. By using vernacular that has become mainstream, graphic
                designers can its familiarity as a tool to attract the attention of
                their viewer.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>Rather than using vernacular for designing, Hardworking Goodlooking
                makes a practice out of researching a specific vernacular. They do this
                by carefully documenting it, and then by working together with local
                designers, to make small scale publications. Through publicizing, they
                aim to transmit this knowledge. By making evident a vernacular, as
                Hardworking Goodlooking does, we graphic designers can play a part in
                celebrating a culture. Hardworking Goodlooking takes on the role of
                researcher and collaborator in using vernacular<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The next designer is working with the physical manifestations of
                vernacular design. Helmut Smits uses vernacular objects as contemporary
                <em>found objects</em>. By reshaping their known forms into new objects,
                he aims to rethink the meaning of those objects in our daily life. Smits
                takes on a more fine arts approach to working with vernacular.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>In his project “Scheve Palen” or “Slammed Posts” Onno Blase looks at
                the street with a poetic eye. He notices a visual language that is
                coincidental. Blase says “It’s super simple idea and a maniacal project.
                I hope it brings a smile to your face. I hope it makes you look around
                more when you’re walking or cycling through your city, and observe what
                you see<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>.” Designers like Onno Blase and
                Helmut Smits transform the daily activity of vision itself into a more
                self-conscious activity. To not only see the world, but see the beauty,
                humor or what so ever in everyday things. It is interesting to see in
                Blase’s project that vernacular has been taking on a digital dimension.
                By sharing these findings on Instagram Slammed Posts turned into a
                collaborative project between Blase and his followers, creating a sense
                of community. A poetic and communal approach to working with
                vernacular.</p>

            <h3>Vernacular of the future: how about my neighborhood?</h3>
            <p><strong>While writing this thesis I realized researching vernacular
                can’t only be done by analyzing the work of designers… I decided to
                investigate the vernacular of my own surroundings, starting in my
                neighborhood.</strong></p>

            <p>I have been living on the Admiraal de Ruyterweg for almost five years
                now. I have seen the local bridal store go, and a big, polished
                <em>Appie<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></em>take its place. I have seen the
                elderly moving out of apartments next to mine, and young, urban,
                professionals, moving in. The process of gentrification<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
                has played out before my eyes, and when I imagine my neighborhood in 20
                years I only see this developing further. This doesn’t sound so nice
                does it, <em>hé<a href="https://voetnoten-charlotte.surge.sh/#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></em>?</p>
                <p>That is why I started to look at the local places that are still
                    there. The places that bring a sense of identity to my neighborhood.</p>

                <p>What I found interesting to see in many of the designs of
                storefronts, is the use of certain symbols, that you could say are
                universal in their use. I kept spotting these symbols, and it appealed
                to me that fairly some stores creatively combined different ones.
                Creating very specific, personal meanings.</p>

            <p>I started to sketch with the designs of these window sights, trying
                to see if I could gain more knowledge over these visual languages by
                using them myself.</p>

                <p>During this process I often thought back to Oroza: <em>“Romanticizing
                    aesthetics that are born from poverty and scarcity should be avoided -
                    it should be seen as fixing one’s practical need with the tools one
                    has”. </em>I felt a bit obliged to make these sketches. With my expensive laptop and my design education,
                    what was I trying to achieve? At first the
                    sketching felt a bit aimless, to be honest. However, when I went back to
                    my Instagram archive, I started to understand. The capturing of
                    small details, quirky edges and smirky stains that I have been doing, are an attempt to understand my surroundings.
                    They are a hunting towards the authentic parts of a place. The parts that give a place its identity.</p>

                    <p> I saw that I especially do it in the
                    places I feel are getting too ‘clean’, like my neighborhood that is
                    getting gentrified or in case of my Instagram, social media platforms
                    that are getting cleaned by algorithms. These subtle changes will
                    unconsciously change your view of the world. What do we lose when an
                    <em>appie</em> replaces the local supermarket? And in 20 years, will I
                    still be able to see spray painted numbers on the pavement, and feel the
                    tingle to design a poster?</p>
                    <p>Our surroundings are changing so rapidly, but to notice these things
                        is important. It is the first step in lending a voice to your
                        surrounding. These pictures are the evidence of my surrounding speaking to me,
                        let them speak to you.</p>

            <summary>Conclusion</summary>
            <p>We’re arriving where we started. With both our interests in a
                designing as a response to the world around us. By looking, by living,
                and by making. In the end, vernacular, communication and social
                relations are inextricably connected. What kind of advertisements do you
                have in your Instagram feed, what kind of products do you have in your
                fridge, or even, what kind of texts did you receive today?</p>
                <p>Vernacular is all about belonging to a place and to a specific group.
                Although we have to watch out not to romanticize the use of design that
                is born out of necessity, we have seen that the use of vernacular is a
                rich and valuable source within graphic design and communication. What
                would happen if we would design a vernacular for ourselves? What
                audience would we belong to? What are the things that are important for
                you, or me? And what could be the voice of that? As graphic designers,
                as communicators and creators of identity, we have a role to allow space
                for the identity of the local. Because for me it’s the little gestures
                that make me feel like I’m at home. I hope I have inspired you to look
                around, perhaps in your own neighborhood. And you might even design a
                poster, who knows! Let’s use our skill. Let’s do what we’re good at, and
                design something <em>beyond spectacular, made vernacular.</em></p>
