                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p><strong>Looking back at my upbringing and my daily life in Rotterdam,
                    I realized how much the sight of- and happenings on these streets are a
                    source of inspiration in my work. In a surrounding with people who are
                    all great designers - how privileged I am - I started to become
                    intrigued by designs who were made by people who, most likely, are not
                    designers: vernacular design. Vernacular is defined as an informal
                    visual- and spoken language that belongs to a specific group of people.
                    It is invented rather than taught. I am curious, what is the role of
                    vernacular design in graphic design and communication?</strong></p>
                    <details class="is-read-more">
                        <summary>read more...</summary>
                        <p>I write my thesis as a letter to a first year graphic design student,
                            and to answer this question I start by analyzing developments in art and
                            design that led graphic designers to use vernacular in their work. For
                            this I use the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) poster as a
                            case-study. The IFFR has been taking place in Rotterdam each year from
                            1972 until today. As an event that is leading for the city of Rotterdam
                            and with an archive of over 50 years of posters this seems a perfect
                            documentation of different visual era’s in graphic design.</p>
                            <p>I introduce the material to the reader through means of categorizing
                            the posters by designer, and giving historical context. Through a
                            personal analysis of the style elements in the poster, I link it to
                            different theoretical sources. I see that graphic design is a way to
                            socially organize groups of people. By using vernacular, graphic
                            designers can reach a specific audience. I notice a pattern of graphic
                            designers reaching towards the vernacular after periods of technical
                            development. These technical developments have made them to distinguish
                            themselves. Using vernacular languages is a way in which they do.</p>
                            <p>By presenting a personal selection of contemporary graphic design
                            projects, I analyze which roles graphic designers embody nowadays when
                            using vernacular design. In the last chapter I start researching the
                            vernacular of my own surroundings. Through analyzing the storefronts in
                            my street I try to identify the design ‘strategies’ that are used. I
                            then question what would be the target audience me and my pen-friend
                            belong to, and what would be the vernacular for this? I will extend this
                            research in my graduation project.

                <summary>Introduction</summary>
                <p><strong>Last week my friend told me: “when I am with you, you
                    constantly see design in things I would never see. For instance the
                    bright yellow numbers construction workers spray paint on the pavement.
                    I wouldn’t even see it, but because you took a picture of it I am seeing
                    it everywhere now”.Looking back at my upbringing and my daily life in
                    Rotterdam, I realized how much the sight of- and happenings on these
                    streets are a source of inspiration in my work. Here I encounter great
                    designs everyday, which I keep in an archive on my phone. Over the years
                    this archive has been growing and growing, functioning as the content as
                    well as inspiration for my projects. I have been archiving these random
                    designs for years now. Because I am a sucker for design. And you must be
                    too, because you are reading a fourth years graphic design thesis. You
                    must probably do something with design yourself, maybe a starting
                    graphic designer, a curious first year?</strong></p>
                    <p>I welcome you. Not that I am so much above you that I have the
                    authority to welcome you. I am also just getting started. And I can tell
                    you: the more you learn the more you learn you don’t know anything. This
                    thesis started as an attempt to understand something of graphic design,
                    but failed miserably. It left me with more questions… but we’re in this
                    together. You, first year graphic designer, and me, fourth year graphic
                    designer. Both curious.</p>
                    <p>When I was in your shoes, when I started graphic design at KABK, I
                    started to notice these random designs. Looking back I think that was
                    the combination of my voyeurism and learning “How Design Is Actually
                    Done”. In a surrounding with people who are all great designers - how
                    privileged we both are - I started to become intrigued with designs that
                    don’t feel “designed”, that have a certain rough, unpolished beauty.
                    Designs who were made by people who, most likely, are not designers.
                    Designs that are made vernacular.</p>
                    <p>In “We’re Here To Be Bad” Tibor Kalman writes “Vernacular is a slang,
                    a language invented rather than taught. Vernacular design is a visual
                    slang. More than that it’s design that is so familiar that we don’t
                    really see it. Seeing the vernacular is seeing the invisible. It is
                    looking at something commonplace - a yellow pencil, a metal folding
                    chair- and falling in love<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
                    id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>”.</p>
                    <p>But we are training to become professional designers. “Invented
                    rather than taught” is how Kalman aims us to look at vernacular design.
                    Vernacular design is not done as an education, nor can it be seen as a
                    movement or style in design. It is a process. And a rather
                    straightforward one; a direct supply of design to the question of fixing
                    one’s practical need. It is done locally, when a store hires a sign
                    painter to paint their window-glass, or when the construction worker
                    spray paints numbers on the pavement to locate where they placed their
                    underground cables.</p>
                    <p>Vernacular design is practical design. It is communication without
                    the strategy or research that we are being taught. And I guess that
                    makes it direct and unfiltered; it has not been given rules. There is no
                    good and no bad. And that is what is good about it. So then, as wanting
                    to be great designers, how can we learn from vernacular? Are there ways
                    in which we are able to combine vernacular with strategy; as Hannah
                    Montana would say; the best of both worlds<a href="#fn2"
                    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>? I
                    am curious, what is the role of vernacular design in graphic design and
                    communication?</p>
                    <p>This summer I have done my internship at 75B in Rotterdam, where I
                    had the opportunity to work on this years IFFR campaign. The IFFR has
                    been taking place in Rotterdam each year from 1972 until today and over
                    the years they have built up a reputation of placing political topics on
                    the agenda. In their 2021-2024 report they write “IFFR manifests itself
                    as a ‘window to the world’, in which Rotterdam and the Netherlands open
                    up to the world, and vice versa. In doing so, the festival offers space
                    for intercultural dialogue and reflection in the city of Rotterdam. It
                    stimulates the expansion of mutual understanding between cultures or the
                    nuancing of existing prejudices - so important in today’s polarized
                    climate<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
                    role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.” As an event that is leading for
                    the city of Rotterdam and with an archive of over 50 years of posters
                    this seems a perfect documentation for us to explore different visual
                    era’s in graphic design.</p>

                <p><strong>For this chapter I divided the posters in six timeframes,
                    divided by six makers (see fig. 1). I chose six designers of which I
                    think most interestingly reflect graphic design’s development. Can we
                    detect certain notions that caused graphic designers to turn to the
                    vernacular? My ambition is not to provide you with a complete history of
                    graphic design, but rather, to help both you and me to start a little
                    more informed designers that we are.</strong></p>
                    <h3>Punk Panthers: Evert Maliangkay</h3>
                    <p>Let’s look at the very beginning of the IFFR: the posters designed by
                    Evert Maliangkay. Maliangkay was born in Rotterdam in 1941, where he
                    studied at the Willem de Kooning Academy; Graphic Design by day, and
                    Autonomous Art by night.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>One year before Maliangkay was born, Rotterdam had been bombed. In
                    1940, during the German Luftwaffe in the blitz of the Second World War,
                    almost the entire city center had been destroyed. During our first few
                    designers (from Evert Maliangkay until Hard Werken) the city was still
                    in wederopbouw, the process of rebuilding and re-organizing a broken
                    city. When we look at the posters designed by Maliangkay in 1974, what
                    is immediately striking, is the use of collage. The collage technique,
                    or more broadly, do-it-yourself (DIY) graphic design, emerged after the
                    Second World War when new technologies had been invented that made the
                    production of construction materials much cheaper. For instance the
                    invention of the photocopier in 1959. Because of the access to tools and
                    materials, anyone now could be an artist or designers. Artists, people,
                    anyone, could now pick up scissors, glue and copy a fancy design. This
                    showed you didn’t need to be a professional to make a great design. The
                    collage technique was made famous by the punk movement, who picked up
                    this wave of DIY design to make underground zines. The punk movement was
                    a reaction on the period after the war from the youth, who wanted
                    freedom and radically started to rebel any kind of rules or authority.
                    Collage technique was perfect to break away from formal design rules set
                    by modernist. Visual language does not only serve stylistic purpose, but
                    is acts as an identifier of which social group you (want to) belong
                    to.</p>
                    <h3>Griddy Gust: Gust Romijn</h3>
                    <p>From edition 6 until 10, the IFFR poster has been designed by the
                    Rotterdam artist and designer Gust Romijn. Gust Romijn was trained an
                    architect, but started to work as a sculptor, painter and graphic
                    artist.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img loading="lazy" src="content/images/IFFR/romijn1.jpg" alt="figure1">

                    </figure>
                    <p>When we compare these posters to the posters designed by Maliangkay,
                    these ones look much more structured. That is mainly due to the text
                    placement, that is done straight, in lines. This was a clear influence
                    of the use of a grid, introduced by the modernists. The modernist
                    movement was a completely different response to the Second World War as
                    we had seen from the punk movement. It was a response in which designers
                    wanted to create clarity and order in the world through design. Design
                    for one organization should have one coherent strategy. One could create
                    coherence by limiting the amount of choices in their design; by using a
                    grid.</p>
                    <p>The grid was a sheet of paper with lines, placed under or on top of
                    the design, on which text, image, and column measurements where decided.
                    Aside from using a grid, the influence of modernists was the use of less
                    or only monotone color, and illustrations reduced to geometric
                    shapes.<br />
                    These new design “rules” not only created coherence but also made it
                    easier for designers to give specific instructions to printers. This
                    gave way for production processes to be mechanized and up-scaled. The
                    visual coherence and the mechanization soon caused big companies to hire
                    modernist graphic designers to look at their identity. Service providers
                    like airline KLM or supermarket chain Albert Heijn employed design
                    studios. A new genre in visual culture emerged; corporate
                    identities.</p>
                    <p>Corporate identities demanded a level of quality and skill that
                    graphic designers (like us) could only learn through a formal design
                    education. Where at the one side of the coin of these technical
                    developments, designers like Maliangkay joined the movement of designers
                    being ‘amateurs’ by refusing to work with them, others like Romijn used
                    them to keep up with the corporate business.</p>
                    <h3>Rotterdamse cowboys: Hard Werken</h3>
                    <p>The third ones in line to design the IFFR posters were the members of
                    Hard Werken. Hard Werken was a graphic design collective in Rotterdam,
                    formed in the late 1970’s and became quite famous in the 1980’s. They
                    consisted out of Henk Elenga, Gerard Hadders, Tom van den Haspel, Rick
                    Vermeulen, Kees de Gruiter and Willem Kars.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p> In the designs they made for IFFR from 1986 until 1992, Hard Werken introduced staged photography to
                    the poster. Gerard Hadders in an interview says the poster series are
                    inspired by the pre-digital special effects that were used in movies in
                    the 1940’s. The tiger was built into a decor for each poster, which they
                    would photograph into a poster. Different techniques were used: neon,
                    hot metal, a flower bouquet or fake blood on pavement.</p>
                    <p>Hard Werken identified themself with the postmodern generation of
                    designers. Postmodernism, as the term indicates, was formed opposed the
                    modernist movement. It was more a way of thinking about design than it
                    could be described as an art movement. Where modernist designers claimed
                    their stance as being an authority in deciding what is “good” design,
                    postmodern designers wanted to erase the boundaries between ‘high’ and
                    ‘low’ art because they found anything could be art. Artists like
                    Duchamp, which I don’t doubt you know, presented “found” objects like a
                    toilet with a plate saying “fountain”, and that was then art. It rocked
                    the art world.</p>
                    <p>Hard Werken worked with found objects through staged photography. In
                    their book “Hard Werken - One For All” they show that by presenting
                    everyday objects in a different context, staged photography was a way
                    through which they could imagine a new world within the already existing
                    one.</p>
                    <p>This utopian idea can well be expressed in the quote “Sous les pavés,
                    la plage!”, which loosely translates to “underneath the pavement the
                    beach”, a slogan used in Paris student revolts in May 1968. The slogan
                    expressed the wish to imagine another world, where other possibilities
                    and alternative ways of being and living existed, beyond all the social
                    and political structures that we are in, beyond the artificiality of
                    living in a big city.</p>
                    <p>At this time Rotterdam was being rebuilt and growing into a big city.
                    The harbor expanded into the largest seaport of Europe, housing big
                    companies. Modernist designers grew into marketing designers, using
                    visual strategies. Postmodern designers like Hard Werken then used
                    vernacular as a way to look critical at the growing consumer culture in
                    Rotterdam.</p>
                    <h3>Kisman and the PC: Max Kisman</h3>
                    <p>From 1996 until 2002 Max Kisman designed the festival poster. Kisman
                    was born in Doetinchem, and between 1972 and 1977 he studied typography,
                    illustration, animation and graphic design, at the AKI in Enschede and
                    the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>When we look at the posters, we see that Kisman was the first to
                    introduce digital effects. The rise of the personal-computer in the late
                    1990’s gave way to designers to work with image and text in programs. In
                    Kisman’s words “The introduction of the computer showed that everything
                    is malleable. Manipulable”. The computer brought upon a new generation
                    of graphic designers that mastered design programs, and where able to
                    design basically anything. Graphic designers started to play with
                    typefaces and effects on images.</p>
                    <p>Not only did the home computer give way to designers to broaden their
                    visual language, but when the home computer became affordable it became
                    a tool for everyone and anyone to be able to design. Now ‘amateurs’
                    could reach the same level of quality as designers. The level of quality
                    that modernist graphic designers held for the profession, was being
                    challenged. And with that, the idea of the graphic designer as a
                    professional. Because if everyone was now a good designer, how could you
                    differentiate yourself?</p>
                    <h3>To Romanticize or not to romanticize: Ontwerpwerk</h3>
                    <p>After Max Kisman, Ontwerpwerk designed the IFFR poster. Ontwerpwerk
                    started in 1986 as an advertisement and strategy bureau, in The Hague.
                    Nowadays they are with a team of 40 designers, digital experts and
                    strategists, and are still operative from The Hague. On the 19th of
                    January I was able to talk to former Ontwerpwerk member Stephan Csikós
                    through e-mail.</p>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>Image source: personal archive Stephan Csikós</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>What is particularly striking in their series of posters
                    is their 2002 poster, in which they showcase a series of stores and
                    restaurants in Rotterdam, with the festival’s information and the IFFR
                    logo by Max Kisman on top. In the first poster Ice Cream parlor Venezia
                    is photographed, and in the second the African restaurant Mamma Essi.
                    Stephan Csikós told me that the idea behind this design was that
                    everyone had to leave because the Film Festival had begun.</p>
                    <p>What is interesting when comparing these posters to the ones made by
                    Kisman, is that through the facades Ontwerpwerk is quite literally using
                    vernacular in their design. We can start to detect a pattern here: when
                    technical developments in the graphic field take place, graphic
                    designers are made to rethink their position. In commercial settings,
                    often by having to distinguish themselves in a way. In “We’re Here to be
                    Bad” Tibor Kalman writes: “what is then the point of practicing graphic
                    design? To try and unlearn design. To not design in ways corporations
                    have taught us. And one way to do this, is to look at vernacular
                    design”.</p>
                    <p>With their photographs of Roffa’s streetvernacular, Ontwerpwerk
                    addresses the inhabitants of Rotterdam. They address them with something
                    Rotterdam has come to be known for; their multicultural identity. This
                    identity started to develop when the rebuilt of the city after WW2
                    demanded extra hands. In the years after the war many guest workers came
                    to the Netherlands. Most of those guest workers stayed and became
                    working-class citizens, opening up their own small business.</p>
                    <p>These businesses are one of the physical manifestations of the visual
                    vernacular of a people. People with another cultural background then us
                    can form an interesting subject to use the vernacular of. And for many
                    graphic designers, it does. However, an important side note to this is
                    placed by Cuban designer Ernesto Oroza: ““Romanticizing aesthetics that
                    are born from poverty and scarcity should be avoided. Vernacular should
                    not be seen as an aesthetic practice - even though in my opinion it
                    often has beauty - it should be seen as fixing one’s practical need with
                    the tools one has”.</p>
                    <h3>The shepards: 75B</h3>
                    <p>In 2008 the Rotterdam design agency 75B took over the identity of
                    IFFR. 75B was founded in 1997 by Robert Beckand, Rens Muis and Pieter
                    Vos, who knew each other from studying graphic design at the Willem de
                    Kooning Academy in Rotterdam. Nowadays the firm is ran by Rens Muis and
                    Pieter Vos, and is still housed in Rotterdam. In their second IFFR
                    campaign they introduced the new logo and identity, which is still in
                    use of today.</p>

                    <p>In 75B’s posters we see different visual languages coming together.
                    The time in which graphic designers nowadays are operating, is what
                    Florian Cramer calls the “post-digital’ era. This is the era in which
                    graphic design has become a hybrid of “old” and “new” media. Rens Muis
                    he told me “there are no schools in design anymore. You take whatever
                    technique suits your idea, and use it”. Through expansion of digital
                    techniques such as social-media, we have access and knowledge about many
                    different visual languages.</p>
                    <p>In comparison to Ontwerpwerk, 75B is creating their own visual
                    languages out of different vernacular aesthetics. When combining or
                    morphing such specific visual languages, graphic designers can play with
                    certain cultural or social codes. 75B is not only using vernacular, they
                    also research their target audience through detecting their vernacular
                    behaviors. Using vernacular is thus a way in which graphic designers can
                    socially organize a group.</p>

                <p><strong>Now the IFFR poster has one main purpose, and that is to
                    motivate people to come to the festival. Using vernacular is thus an
                    aesthetic practice in this regard. But what happens when vernacular is
                    used for a different purpose? Which roles do graphic designers take on
                    then? Let’s try to find out through this personal selection of
                    contemporary graphic design projects.</strong></p>

                    <p>As much as graphic designers can use vernacular to address a specific
                    group, that much they can use vernacular to criticize a specific group.
                    More specifically: graphic designers can use their position and
                    knowledge of design to detect marketing strategies by big companies, and
                    possibly make other people aware of them. By combining two marketing
                    strategies with opposed goals, 75B turn both communications against
                    itself, creating an ironic message.</p>

                    <p>Another graphic designer that takes on the role of critic in
                    designing with vernacular, is Yuri Veerman. Here he uses the visual
                    language of mass manufacturers and political parties to transmit his own
                    messages. By using mainstream vernacular, graphic designers can use
                    familiarity as a tool to attract the attention of their viewer.</p>

                    <p>Rather than using vernacular for designing, ‘Hardworking Goodlooking’
                    makes a practice out of researching a specific vernacular. They do this
                    by carefully documenting it, and then by working together with local
                    designers, to make small scale publications. Through publicizing, they
                    aim to transmit this knowledge. Hardworking Goodlooking takes on the
                    role of researcher and collaborator in using vernacular.</p>

                    <p>The next designer is working with the physical manifestations of
                    vernacular design. Helmut Smits is using vernacular objects as
                    contemporary found objects. By reshaping their known forms into new
                    objects, he aims to rethink their meaning, and through that, our use of
                    objects in daily life. He takes on a more fine-arts approach to working
                    with vernacular.</p>

                    <p>In his project “Scheve Palen” or “Slammed Posts” Onno Blase looks at
                    the street with a poetic eye. He notices a visual language that is
                    coincidental. In an interview he says “It’s super simple idea and a
                    maniacal project. I hope it brings a smile to your face. I hope it makes
                    you look around more when you’re walking or cycling through your city,
                    and observe what you see.” Designers like Onno Blase and Helmut Smits
                    transform the daily activity of vision itself into a more self-conscious
                    activity. To not only see the world, but see the beauty, humor or what
                    so ever in everyday things. What is interesting to see in Blase’s
                    project, is that vernacular has been taking on a digital dimension. By
                    sharing these findings on Instagram Slammed Posts turned into a
                    collaborative project between Blase and his followers, creating a sense
                    of community. They are building a vernacular out of slammed posts.</p>

                <summary>Future</summary>
                <p>While writing this thesis I realized researching vernacular can’t
                    only be done by analyzing the work of designers… I decided to
                    investigate the vernacular in my own surroundings, starting with my
                    neighborhood. I have been living on the Admiraal de Ruyterweg for almost
                    five years now. I have seen the local bridal store go, and a big,
                    polished Appie take its place. I have seen the elderly moving out of
                    apartments next to mine, and young, urban, professionals, moving in. The
                    process of gentrification has played out before my eyes, and when I
                    imagine my neighborhood in 20 years I only see this developing further.
                    This doesn’t sound so nice does it, hé? That is why I started to look at
                    the local places that are still there. The places that give my
                    neighborhood identity.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>What I found interesting to see in many of the designs of
                    storefronts, is the use of certain symbols, that you could say, are
                    universal in their use.</p>
                    <p>I kept on looking at these symbols, and what appealed to me was that
                    quite some storefronts creatively combined different ones, to create a
                    specific meaning. What graphic designers as 75B and Yuri Veerman are
                    doing, local designers are also doing. These designs are the physical
                    proof everyone possesses creativity. And also; how much knowledge of
                    visual language we gain simply by living in an era of being exposed to
                    crazy amounts of images. The image seems to become more important than
                    text.</p>
                    <p>I started to sketch with the designs of these window sights, trying
                    to see if I could gain more knowledge over these visual languages by
                    using them myself.</p>
                    <p>During this process I often thought back to Oroza: “Romanticizing
                    aesthetics that are born from poverty and scarcity should be avoided.
                    […] it should be seen as fixing one’s practical need with the tools one
                    has”. Now I have quite some design tools, and what I am designing is not
                    for the same purpose as my local shops. I often felt obliged to make
                    these sketches, but I knew there was something in there. When returning
                    to my archive of pictures, I started to understand. This is exactly what
                    I have been doing when I started posting my vernacular findings on
                    Instagram. Trying to bring “vernacular” things back into that social
                    media world. A surrounding that is has been cleaned by algorithms,
                    robbed of details and weird edges. I am doing that with my gentrified
                    neighborhood here; trying to bring back a personal voice.</p>

                <summary>Conclusion</summary>
                <p>We’re arriving where we started. With both our interests in a
                    designing as a response to the world around us. By looking, by living,
                    and by making. In the end, vernacular, communication and social
                    relations are inextricably connected. What kind of advertisements do you
                    have in your Instagram feed, what kind of products do you have in your
                    fridge, or even, what kind of texts did you receive today? Vernacular is
                    all about belonging to a specific group. Although we have to watch out
                    not to romanticize the use of design that is born out of necessity, the
                    sincere interest in a group is human. The desire to belong to a group is
                    human. What would happen if we would design a vernacular for ourselves?
                    What audience would we belong to? What are the things that are important
                    for you, or me? And what could be the voice of that? Let’s use our
                    skill. Let’s do what we’re good at, and design something that is beyond
                    spectacular; made vernacular.</p>
