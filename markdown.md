**Now the IFFR poster has one main purpose, and that is to motivate people to come to the festival. Using vernacular is thus an aesthetic practice in this regard. But what happens when vernacular is used for a different purpose? Which roles do graphic designers take on then? Let’s try to find out through this personal selection of contemporary graphic design projects.**

As much as graphic designers can use vernacular to address a specific group, that much they can use vernacular to criticize a specific group. More specifically: graphic designers can use their position and knowledge of design to detect marketing strategies by big companies, and possibly make other people aware of them. By combining two marketing strategies with opposed goals, 75B turn both communications against itself, creating an ironic message. 

Another graphic designer that takes on the role of critic in designing with vernacular, is Yuri Veerman. Here he uses the visual language of mass manufacturers and political parties to transmit his own messages. By using mainstream vernacular, graphic designers can use familiarity as a tool to attract the attention of their viewer.

Rather than using vernacular for designing, ‘Hardworking Goodlooking’ makes a practice out of researching a specific vernacular. They do this by carefully documenting it, and then by working together with local designers, to make small scale publications. Through publicizing, they aim to transmit this knowledge. Hardworking Goodlooking takes on the role of researcher and collaborator in using vernacular. 

The next designer is working with the physical manifestations of vernacular design. Helmut Smits is using 
vernacular objects as contemporary found objects. By reshaping their known forms into new objects, he 
aims to rethink their meaning, and through that, our use of objects in daily life. He takes on a more fine-arts 
approach to working with vernacular. 

In his project “Scheve Palen” or “Slammed Posts” Onno Blase looks at the street with a poetic eye. He notices a visual language that is coincidental. In an interview he says “It’s super simple idea and a maniacal project. I hope it brings a smile to your face. I hope it makes you look around more when you’re walking or cycling through your city, and observe what you see.” Designers like Onno Blase and Helmut Smits transform the daily activity of vision itself into a more self-conscious activity. To not only see the world, but see the beauty, humor or what so ever in everyday things.	What is interesting to see in Blase’s project, is that vernacular has been taking on a digital dimension. By sharing these findings on Instagram Slammed Posts turned into a collaborative project between Blase and his followers, creating a sense of community. They are building a vernacular out of slammed posts.

**For this chapter I divided the posters in six timeframes, divided by six makers (see fig. 1). I chose six designers of which I think most interestingly reflect graphic design’s development. Can we detect certain notions that caused graphic designers to turn to the vernacular? My ambition is not to provide you with a complete history of graphic design, but rather, to help both you and me to start a little more informed designers that we are.**

Punk Panthers: Evert Maliangkay

Let’s look at the very beginning of the IFFR: the posters designed by Evert Maliangkay. Maliangkay was born in Rotterdam in 1941, where he studied at the Willem de Kooning Academy; Graphic Design by day, and Autonomous Art by night.

One year before Maliangkay was born, Rotterdam had been bombed. In 1940, during the German Luftwaffe in the blitz of the Second World War, almost the entire city center had been destroyed. During our first few designers (from Evert Maliangkay until Hard Werken) the city was still in wederopbouw, the process of rebuilding and re-organizing a broken city. 	When we look at the posters designed by Maliangkay in 1974, what is immediately striking, is the use of collage. The collage technique, or more broadly, do-it-yourself (DIY) graphic design, emerged after the Second World War when new technologies had been invented that made the production of construction materials much cheaper. For instance the invention of the photocopier in 1959. Because of the access to tools and materials, anyone now could be an artist or designers. Artists, people, anyone, could now pick up scissors, glue and copy a fancy design. This showed you didn’t need to be a professional to make a great design.
The collage technique was made famous by the punk movement, who picked up this wave of DIY design to make underground zines. The punk movement was a reaction on the period after the war from the youth, who wanted freedom and radically started to rebel any kind of rules or authority. Collage technique was perfect to break away from formal design rules set by modernist. Visual language does not only serve stylistic purpose, but is acts as an identifier of which social group you (want to) belong to. 

Griddy Gust: Gust Romijn

From edition 6 until 10, the IFFR poster has been designed by the Rotterdam artist and designer Gust Romijn. Gust Romijn was trained an architect, but started to work as a sculptor, painter and graphic artist.

When we compare these posters to the posters designed by Maliangkay, these ones look much more structured. That is mainly due to the text placement, that is done straight, in lines. This was a clear influence of the use of a grid, introduced by the modernists. The modernist movement was a completely different response to the Second World War as we had seen from the punk movement. It was a response in which designers wanted to create clarity and order in the world through design. Design for one organization should have one coherent strategy. One could create coherence by limiting the amount of choices in their design; by using a grid. 

The grid was a sheet of paper with lines, placed under or on top of the design, on which text, image, and column measurements where decided. Aside from using a grid, the influence of modernists was the use of less or only monotone color, and illustrations reduced to geometric shapes.	
These new design “rules” not only created coherence but also made it easier for designers to give specific instructions to printers. This gave way for production processes to be mechanized and up-scaled. The visual coherence and the mechanization soon caused big companies to hire modernist graphic designers to look at their identity. Service providers like airline KLM or supermarket chain Albert Heijn employed design studios. A new genre in visual culture emerged; corporate identities. 

Corporate identities demanded a level of quality and skill that graphic designers (like us) could only learn through a formal design education. Where at the one side of the coin of these technical developments,  designers like Maliangkay joined the movement of designers being ‘amateurs’ by refusing to work with them, others like Romijn used them to keep up with the corporate business.

Rotterdamse cowboys: Hard Werken

The third ones in line to design the IFFR posters were the members of Hard Werken. Hard Werken was a graphic design collective in Rotterdam, formed in the late 1970’s and became quite famous in the 1980’s. They consisted out of Henk Elenga, Gerard Hadders, Tom van den Haspel, Rick Vermeulen, Kees de Gruiter and Willem Kars. In the designs they made for IFFR from 1986 until 1992, Hard Werken introduced staged photography to the poster. Gerard Hadders in an interview says the poster series are inspired by the pre-digital special effects that were used in movies in the 1940's. The tiger was built into a decor for each poster, which they would photograph into a poster. Different techniques were used: neon, hot metal, a flower bouquet or fake blood on pavement. 

Hard Werken identified themself with the postmodern generation of designers. Postmodernism, as the term indicates, was formed opposed the modernist movement. It was more a way of thinking about design than it could be described as an art movement. Where modernist designers claimed their stance as being an authority in deciding what is “good” design, postmodern designers wanted to erase the boundaries between ‘high’ and ‘low’ art because they found anything could be art. Artists like Duchamp, which I don’t doubt you know, presented “found” objects like a toilet with a plate saying “fountain”, and that was then art. It rocked the art world. 

Hard Werken worked with found objects through staged photography. In their book “Hard Werken - One For All” they show that by presenting everyday objects in a different context, staged photography was a way through which they could imagine a new world within the already existing one. 	

This utopian idea can well be expressed in the quote "Sous les pavés, la plage!”, which loosely translates to “underneath the pavement the beach”, a slogan used in Paris student revolts in May 1968. The slogan expressed the wish to imagine another world, where other possibilities and alternative ways of being and living existed, beyond all the social and political structures that we are in, beyond the artificiality of living in a big city.

At this time Rotterdam was being rebuilt and growing into a big city. The harbor expanded into the largest seaport of Europe, housing big companies. Modernist designers grew into marketing designers, using visual strategies. Postmodern designers like Hard Werken then used vernacular as a way to look critical at the growing consumer culture in Rotterdam. 

Kisman and the PC: Max Kisman

From 1996 until 2002 Max Kisman designed the festival poster. Kisman was born in Doetinchem, and between 1972 and 1977 he studied typography, illustration, animation and graphic design, at the AKI in Enschede and the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam.

When we look at the posters, we see that Kisman was the first to introduce digital effects. The rise of the personal-computer in the late 1990’s gave way to designers to work with image and text in programs. In Kisman’s words “The introduction of the computer showed that everything is malleable. Manipulable”. The computer brought upon a new generation of graphic designers that mastered design programs, and where able to design basically anything. Graphic designers started to play with typefaces and effects on images. 

Not only did the home computer give way to designers to broaden their visual language, but when the home computer became affordable it became a tool for everyone and anyone to be able to design. Now ‘amateurs’ could reach the same level of quality as designers. The level of quality that modernist graphic designers held for the profession, was being challenged. And with that, the idea of the graphic designer as a professional. Because if everyone was now a good designer, how could you differentiate yourself?

To Romanticize or not to romanticize (Ontwerpwerk)

After Max Kisman, Ontwerpwerk designed the IFFR poster. Ontwerpwerk started in 1986 as an advertisement and strategy bureau, in The Hague. Nowadays they are with a team of 40 designers, digital experts and strategists, and are still operative from The Hague. On the 19th of January I was able to talk to former Ontwerpwerk member Stephan Csikós through e-mail.What is particularly striking in their series of posters is their 2002 poster, in which they showcase a series of stores and restaurants in Rotterdam, with the festival’s information and the IFFR logo by Max Kisman on top. In the first poster Ice Cream parlor Venezia is photographed, and in the second the African restaurant Mamma Essi. Stephan Csikós told me that the idea behind this design was that everyone had to leave because the Film Festival had begun.

What is interesting when comparing these posters to the ones made by Kisman, is that through the facades Ontwerpwerk is quite literally using vernacular in their design. We can start to detect a pattern here: when technical developments in the graphic field take place, graphic designers are made to rethink their position. In commercial settings, often by having to distinguish themselves in a way. In “We’re Here to be Bad” Tibor Kalman writes: “what is then the point of practicing graphic design? To try and unlearn design. To not design in ways corporations have taught us. And one way to do this, is to look at vernacular design”. 

With their photographs of Roffa’s streetvernacular, Ontwerpwerk addresses the inhabitants of Rotterdam. They address them with something Rotterdam has come to be known for; their multicultural identity. This identity started to develop when the rebuilt of the city after WW2 demanded extra hands. In the years after the war many guest workers came to the Netherlands. Most of those guest workers stayed and became working-class citizens, opening up their own small business. 

These businesses are one of the physical manifestations of the visual vernacular of a people. People with another cultural background then us can form an interesting subject to use the vernacular of. And for many graphic designers, it does. However, an important side note to this is placed by Cuban designer Ernesto Oroza: ““Romanticizing aesthetics that are born from poverty and scarcity should be avoided. Vernacular should not be seen as an aesthetic practice - even though in my opinion it often has beauty - it should be seen as fixing one’s practical need with the tools one has”.

The shepards: 75B

In 2008 the Rotterdam design agency 75B took over the identity of IFFR. 75B was founded in 1997 by Robert Beckand, Rens Muis and Pieter Vos, who knew each other from studying graphic design at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam. Nowadays the firm is ran by Rens Muis and Pieter Vos, and is still housed in Rotterdam. In their second IFFR campaign they introduced the new logo and identity, which is still in use of today.

In 75B’s posters we see different visual languages coming together. The time in which graphic designers nowadays are operating, is what Florian Cramer calls the “post-digital’ era. This is the era in which graphic design has become a hybrid of “old” and “new” media. Rens Muis he told me “there are no schools in design anymore. You take whatever technique suits your idea, and use it”. Through expansion of digital techniques such as social-media, we have access and knowledge about many different visual languages. 

In comparison to Ontwerpwerk, 75B is creating their own visual languages out of different vernacular aesthetics. When combining or morphing such specific visual languages, graphic designers can play with certain cultural or social codes. 75B is not only using vernacular, they also research their target audience through detecting their vernacular behaviors. Using vernacular is thus a way in which graphic designers can  socially organize a group.
